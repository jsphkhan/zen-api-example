This is a Node Express REST API server
It mocks the Github Zen API

So when user requests this API, it sends random strings as response

Endpoint:
-----------
/zen - returns random strings

Deployment:
------------
1. Docker container based inside AWS EC2 instance
2. AWS Cloud using Elastic BeanStalk and AWS Code Pipeline - this is used right now.

Rate Limiter:
--------------
You must prevent the API from DDoS attacks. Denial of Service. 
If users keep hitting this free API a huge number of times, then my server will crash.

PM2
------
Using PM2 to start node server. 
Node Process Monitor
https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/docker-pm2-nodejs/

pm2 start server.js
pm2 stop server

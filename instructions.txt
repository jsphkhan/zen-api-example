This is a Node Express REST API server
It mocks the Github Zen API

So when user requests this API, it sends random strings as response

Endpoint:
-----------
/zen - returns random strings

Deployment:
------------
ASW Cloud using Elastic BeanStalk

Rate Limiter:
--------------
You must prevent the API from DDoS attacks. Denial of Service. 
If users keep hitting this free API a huge number of times, then my server will crash.
